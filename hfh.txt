1. Juan Builds - focusing on construction activities
2. Juan Brigades - community centred: feeding programs, tutoring kids, seminars for youths, etc.

Which one should we aim for? I would like to inform them first that we plan to partner with them as long as possible and explain to them our setup (trisemester with classes for the last two terms, although this year and next year last term lang may classes; and class outreaches are held on the second to last month of the term) before choosing any program u_u

Good Day!

Thank you for your response, and we apologize for the delay in ours!
 
Firstly, we would like to inform you that our organization facilitates a class that is taught to freshmen in the 2nd and 3rd term of a trimester, however for this year and the next, we will be only having classes in the 3rd term. 

In these classes, we are required to have at least one outreach activity that occurs sometime in the 2nd to last month of each term (blahhh). As such, we request to participate in your JUAN BUILDS OUTREACH for the coming terms.

We do not have a date yet for the upcoming outreach but it will be sometime in July. Also, i am kindly requesting for a brief (a presentation deck, a primer, etc.) on JUANBUILDS that we can present to our organization head. Once the dates have been approved, we will get back to you at the soonest. 

Thank you very much and God Bless!
