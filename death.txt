we're here to present not only an idea, but a dream. and only the risk-takers, the adventurous, and those who have the audacity to move forward can join us. 

Tickets. Its an ancient concept being used in the modern age. (slide pantheon)

so how many of you have lost this ticket? (point to slide art in 		action)

and how many of you have found yourself in this situation? 		(point to slide seminar ticket line)

as students, we understand the dilemma of long ticket lines and lost tickets...and we're here to change that. (cancel two pics)

our app ______ allows you to reserve, organize, and manage your tickets at any time, at your own comfort -- you could be anywhere, doing anything, avoiding the inconveniences that youre used to. it's like having a thousand tickets in your pocket.
 
miss courtney, you can benefit from this app too. although anyone with an account can create an event, teachers who are event organizers can look for students who attended their event and sort it accordingly. imagine it as a google for tickets.

The problem with other developed ticketing systems is that they dont solve 
the problem. They just automate the process. For example, this app (opening eventbrite in pc showing its ticket) has you print the ticket and then has you scan it.

What we're going to do is to reinvent how this works. With the use of NFC, just a tap (tapping two phones. 1 second pause) ... and you're done. Printouts are no longer necessary, and the steps are reduced -- leaving less room for mistakes.

In all, _____ aims to revolutionize online ticketing systems by reducing time and error, and increasing capacity. As Lasallians, we do not settle for the subpar -- we deserve only the best. And ______ offers just that. Thank you for listening!
